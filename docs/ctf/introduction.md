# WTF is a CTF?!

You are the most okayest internet detective ever!  Luckily, you're a pretty rad TDIR analyst. 

A CTF stands for **Capture the Flag**.  It is a game where flags (meaningless text for this CTF) is hidden somewhere.  It may be on the screen, it may be encoded, encrypted or fully encrusted.  Almost every challenge in this game can be performed in a web browser.  It is definitely not contained solely within the Graylog console, but we met the minimum requirements that the accusations 'you just took time off and spent corporate money to party' is only somewhat true. There is plenty of Graylog, TDIR, system admin, general IT, general Nerd, and even some content for our future A.I. leadership.  

Here are the tips to help you look like less of a tourist:
- Some clues will give you a clear direction on where to go and others will be much more subtle.
- Look closely at pictures
- Details matter.  Is something out of place?  Is something a typo?  Sometimes this happens because we suck, other times its because we missed it and more importantly, it usually happens because we're trying to draw your attention to something. 
- Search.  Search hard, search far, search like your depends on it. Search engines have answers.  You will find yourself searching for things like "What sound does a camel make?" or "How many jelly beans fit in a cowboy hat?"
- Don't shy away from A.I.  It's a great tool for this kind of stuff if used wisely.  It can also completely hose you.

We can learn by trying it out.
Here is the flag for the challenge "Getting Started:  WTF is a CTF?"
`This game is cool`

Copy and paste that into the appropriate challenge on your scoreboard page.  

Let's try a harder on.  The next flag *requires selection*: 
<span style="color:white">ultra hidden flag</span>

Use your cursor and select the blank space between this line and the text above and you should find some hidden text!

Now you have an idea on how it works.  Go.  Have fun.  It's amazing when you rack your brains, get frustrated, solve a crazy puzzle and ultimately win the greatest prize of all - the oppurtunity to read all the text I've written.
