# Introduction

Let's be honest. I'm guessing you are here for the free flags or because you failed a wisdom roll, somewhere.  That happens to everyone, I hear.  Luckily, now you get to start the real adventure!

## THIS IS NOT [GRAYLOG DOCUMENTATION](https://go2.graylog.org)

There are professionals for that and they are very good at what they do.  You know who isn't good at what they do?  Users who are tasked with reading documentation. Don't join the herd.

## Thanks for playing

You came here for a crash course in Graylog for the purpose of winning a CTF and we don't fault you for that.  Remember how much fun you had and think of some of the mad genius that went into these puzzles and make sure you spread the word about it.  Plus the people that make the Graylog software, this game, the documentation, the events, the marketing, and even the Sales guys are cool.  Heck, even Joe is cool, now.
