# Welcome to the CTF Handbook.

Let's be honest. You are here because you failed a wisdom or initiative roll.  That's cool, now it's time for the real adventure.

THIS IS NOT GRAYLOG DOCUMENTATION.

There are professionals for that and they are very good at what they do.  You know who isn't good at what they do?  Users who are tasked with reading documentation. Don't join the herd.


You can start here for a crash course in Graylog for the purpose of winning a CTF and not at all for the subliminal enjoyment of using our product so that you convince your peers to buy it at work.

Plus the people that make this software, this game, the documentation, the events, the marketing, and even the Sales guys are cool.  Heck, even Joe is cool, now.
