Who doesn't love getting more notifications?  Do you wake up in the morning and demand to receive more things to steal your attention?  If you haven't spent a mandatory 45 minutes today in the restroom scrolling the most important feeds of your life and ignoring the world around you, we have just the tool. 

## More notifications

You can set up these marvelous notification creatures in a lot of ways.  At Graylog, we give you some fantastic options.  Slack, Teams, Discord, PagerDuty - or just straight up HTTP so you can treat your notifications like a Long Island Iced Tea.  A long island iced tea is just the adult version of making swamp water at a fountain drink machine.  They say excessive notifications have caused humans to have shorter attention spans.  Did you know the word Human comes from the latin word 'humus' meaning earth or ground? 

## Squirrel

Look at your toolbar called 'Hooks'.  Now you can build Event Notifications!  Use that URL when it matters.
