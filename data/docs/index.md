# Welcome to the CTF Handbook.

Let's be honest. You are here because you failed a wisdom or initiative roll.  Time for the real adventure.

THIS IS NOT GRAYLOG DOCUMENTATION.  There are actual professionals for that and they are very good at what they do.  You know who isn't good at what they do?  People who are tasked with reading documentation. Don't join the herd.


Go start with either a crash course in Graylog for the express purpose of winning a CTF and not at all for the subliminal enjoyment of using our product in preparation to buy it at work OR the CTF Adventurers guide because you saw through this scheme and still want to win. 

Plus the people that make this software, this game, the documentation, the events, the marketing, and even the Sales guys are cool.  Heck, even Joe is cool, now.
